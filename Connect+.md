Okay, here's the diff that adds the specified text to the `Connect+.md` file:

```diff
--- a/Connect+.md
+++ b/Connect+.md
@@ -0,0 +1,1 @@
+This document will be referred to later.

```

This diff assumes the `Connect+.md` file is empty initially. If it has existing content, please provide the current content and I can generate a more accurate diff. 

This diff uses the unified format.  
* **`--- a/Connect+.md`:**  Indicates the original file.
* **`+++ b/Connect+.md`:** Indicates the modified file.
* **`+This document will be referred to later.`:** The `+` sign indicates a line added to the file.
