# Connect+ Project Description

## Project Overview
Connect+ is a social media platform designed to foster deeper connections between users by facilitating meaningful interactions and shared experiences. Unlike traditional social media focused on broadcasting content, Connect+ prioritizes quality over quantity, encouraging users to connect based on shared interests, values, and goals.

## Technical Specifications

- **Backend:** Go programming language with Gin framework for API development.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run for scalable and cost-effective deployment.
- **API:** RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Messaging:** Real-time chat functionality using WebSockets.
- **Search:** Robust search capabilities for finding users and groups based on interests and criteria.
- **Notifications:** Push notifications to alert users of relevant activities and events.

## Development Stages

1. **Foundation:** Build the core backend infrastructure, including API endpoints, database schema, and user authentication.
2. **Connections:** Implement features for user discovery, connection requests, and relationship management.
3. **Interactions:** Develop features for real-time messaging, group chats, and event scheduling.
4. **Content Sharing:** Integrate functionality for sharing content, such as posts, images, and videos, within a controlled and meaningful context.
5. **Community Building:** Implement tools for creating and managing groups, facilitating discussions, and organizing events.
6. **Monetization:** Explore potential revenue streams, such as premium features or targeted advertising, while maintaining the platform's core values.

## Success Metrics

- **Active Users:** Track the number of daily and monthly active users.
- **User Engagement:** Measure the frequency and duration of user interactions, such as messages sent, events attended, and content shared.
- **Connection Quality:** Analyze the depth and strength of user connections based on interaction data and feedback.
- **Community Growth:** Monitor the formation and growth of active communities within the platform.
- **User Satisfaction:** Collect user feedback through surveys and reviews to assess satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
- **Revenue Generation:** If monetization is implemented, track revenue streams and their impact on user experience and platform sustainability.
